# Snake Game

An interactive Boggle word game built in Python.
The player searches for valid words on a randomized board of letters before the timer runs out. Words are validated against a dictionary, and the score updates dynamically as you play.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use the **arrow keys** (↑ ↓ ← →) to control the snake’s movement.  
- Eat the **green apples** to grow longer and increase your score.  
- Avoid running into the **walls** or into the snake’s own body — doing so ends the game.  
- The game gets harder as the snake grows longer and space becomes tighter.  
- Press **Play/Restart** to start a new round.
