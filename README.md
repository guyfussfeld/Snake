# Snake Game

An interactive Snake game built in Python. The player controls a snake that moves around the board, eating apples to grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls or itself. Each apple eaten increases the score. The game continues until the snake crashes.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use the **arrow keys** (↑ ↓ ← →) to control the snake’s movement.  
- Eat the **green apples** to grow longer and increase your score.  
- Avoid running into the **walls** or into the snake’s own body — doing so ends the game.
